The `State` struct contains five singletons, one for each of the token's balances, total supply, minter, cap, and frozen balances. Singletons are a type of key-value storage that ensures there is only one instance of a value associated with a specific key. The `State` struct also has a `Default` implementation that initializes each singleton with its respective key.

The `State` implementation contains methods to update and retrieve values from the singletons. The `update_cap` method updates the cap singleton value. The cap method retrieves the cap value from the cap singleton. The `update_minter` method updates the minter singleton value and cap singleton value. The `minter` method retrieves the minter value from the minter singleton. The `mint` method mints tokens and updates the balances singleton and total supply singleton values. The `transfer` method transfers tokens between two accounts and updates the balances singleton values. The `balance` method retrieves the balance of an account from the balances singleton. The `total_supply` method retrieves the total supply from the total supply singleton. The `token_info` method retrieves the token's information from the singletons. The `minter_allowed` method checks if the sender is the minter and if the minter cap is set. The `is_frozen` method checks if an account is frozen. The freeze method freezes an account. The `unfreeze` method unfreezes an account. Finally, the execute method executes the contract's logic and returns the appropriate response.
